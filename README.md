## 👀 I’m interested in
I love everything related to cryptography.

I like learning how certain hash functions and cipher algorithms works and subsequently implementing them in different languages.

Cryptography to me is like magic, you take something that everyone can read, you jumble it up and with the right process you can go back to the original output!

It's an organized chaos!
